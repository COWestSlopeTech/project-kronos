# Pull Request Guidlines

## Pull Request Acceptance
1.  Pull requests need to be reviewed by another member.
2.  A 3rd reviewer should be included when two contributors can't agree on approach OR when the two contributors don't have the specific knowledge needed to agree on the best approach.

## Pull Request Etiquette
1.  After 3 days of no response, person who created PR should ping the community or a specific member as a polite nudge.
2.  A reviewer should demonstrate respect and consideration when reviewing another peers pull request.
3.  If a reviewer doesn't understand or agree with how something was implemented in a pull request they should ask questions to determine why the choices where made when possible. We do not put people down. Instead we will try to understand anothers view point.
